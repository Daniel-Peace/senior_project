# A pipeline for injury detection using ML and AI models

## About this project
This project was worked on for use by Coordianted Robotics. A robotics team that works with students from CSUCI and is currently competing in DARPA's latest competition. This competition, DTC (DARPA Triage Challenge), is focused on the development of autonomus drones that can perform triage to assist first responders in mass casuatly situations. The goal is to use drones to provide data to first responders taht will help them assess the situation and determine how best to apprach the situation to save the most lives.

With that in mind, this project focused on creating a pipline for making predictions about a casualty, combining multiple predictions into one report, and submitting this report to a server to be viewed.
