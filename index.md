<!-- ![profile-picture](/senior_project/images/profile_picture.jpeg "Profile Picture") -->

My name is Daniel peace and I am a recent graduate from CSU Channel Islands. I received a B.S. degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics. My primary fields of interest lie in backend development, AI and ML development, and embedded systems.

Some of my main [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}){: .custom-link} during school included [Autonomous Robot Triage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link autonomous-robot-triage.md %}){: .custom-link}, a system for integrating AI and ML models to predict injuries in mass casualty situations; [BarterBuddy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link barterbuddy.md %}){: .custom-link}, an e-commerce application that allows users to trade items; and [CHAT-429]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link chat429.md %}){: .custom-link}, a terminal-based chat app similar to Discord that lets users create and join various text channels to chat and hang out.

In my free time, I enjoy playing keys and drums for a couple of cover bands that primarily play music from the 70s and 80s. Having played basketball in high school, I still enjoy playing pick-up games at my local gym when I have the time. I'm also a car enthusiast and am particularly fond of old Toyotas. I own a 1981 Land Cruiser that I hope to start working on soon, as well as a 1986 Toyota pickup Iâ€™d like to restore someday.
